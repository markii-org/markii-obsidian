/**
 * Composes every pack-loading piece (`@markii/host`'s `discoverPacks`,
 * `loadPackModules`, `resolvePackPaths`, `buildRenderRegistry`,
 * `packs/pack-build.ts`, `./pack-runtime.ts`) into the one thing
 * `view.tsx` needs: everything about the currently configured, installed
 * packs, loaded once per preview open (docs/packs.md: "reloading a pack
 * requires reopening the preview" — see `../settings-tab.ts`'s note to that
 * effect).
 *
 * The pack-loading pieces this composes are shared, host-neutral logic
 * hoisted into `@markii/host` (used the same way by
 * `apps/vscode/src/packs/pack-context.ts`). The real difference from the
 * VS Code version: that one only builds a webview registration artifact
 * and hands its URI to a webview to load itself; this one goes one step
 * further and actually EVALUATES the compiled script in-process
 * (`./pack-runtime.ts`) and folds the result into a `Registry`
 * (`@markii/host`'s `buildRenderRegistry`), since there is no separate
 * webview process to do that on this host.
 *
 * `obsidian`-free — every Obsidian-specific step (reading the device-local
 * pack-folder setting, resolving the vault base path, injecting the pack
 * stylesheets into `document.head`) stays in `../view.tsx`/`../main.ts`;
 * this module only takes the already-read setting value, the vault root,
 * and a base `Registry`, all as plain values.
