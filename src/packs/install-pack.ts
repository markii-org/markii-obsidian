/**
 * `obsidian`-free logic behind the "Install Markii pack from file" command
 * (AGENTS.md's Host positioning: this is the ONLY way a pack enters this
 * plugin): validates a `.mkp` archive the user picked, refuses one whose
 * namespace is already a bundled pack's, asks for consent (its code will
 * run in the preview), asks before replacing an already-installed pack of
 * the same namespace, and unzips it into this plugin's own `packs`
 * directory (`../main.ts`'s `installedPacksDir`, under the plugin's own
 * on-disk folder, never a folder the user chose and never the user's
 * authored note tree — AGENTS.md's cleanliness rule). A successfully
 * installed pack still needs to be ADDED to this device's trust list
 * (`./pack-trust.ts`) for the preview to actually load it; that write
 * stays in `../main.ts` (only `main.ts`/`view.tsx`/`settings-tab.ts`/
 * `run-modals.ts`/`insert-modals.ts`/`complete-suggest.ts`/
 * `reading-view.ts` may import `obsidian`).
 *
 * A rejected archive installs nothing: `installPackFromArchive` never
 * writes to disk until every check (bundled-namespace refusal, consent,
 * and, when needed, the replace confirmation) has already passed.
