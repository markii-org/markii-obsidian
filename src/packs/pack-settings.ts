 * trust — every folder named here has its `.tsx` sources compiled and
 * evaluated in-process (`./pack-context.ts`, `./pack-runtime.ts`), and any
 * `scripts/*.lua` it ships becomes `require`-able from the Run path. It
 * therefore MUST use `app.saveLocalStorage`/`app.loadLocalStorage`
 * (device-local, never synced or shared with a vault), and MUST NEVER use
 * `Plugin.saveData`/`loadData` (vault-synced `data.json` — see
 * `../run/local-storage-memento.ts`'s top comment for the full rationale
 * and `../storage-boundary.test.ts` for the executable half of this rule).
 *
 * Deliberately `obsidian`-free (like `../local-settings.ts`) so the shape
 * and its hostile-input normalization stay unit-testable without the
 * `obsidian` module.
