/**
 * A native folder picker for the pack-folder setting, matching what the VS
 * Code extension gets for free from `vscode.window.showOpenDialog`
 * (`apps/vscode/src/extension.ts`). Typing an absolute path by hand is how
 * a shell-escaped path like `Obsidian\ Github` ends up in the list, naming
 * a folder that does not exist; picking one cannot produce that.
 *
 * Obsidian's own API has no folder picker, so this reaches for Electron's
 * dialog, which the desktop app's renderer exposes. That reach is
 * DEFENSIVE on purpose: the module is resolved at call time, every shape it
 * has been exposed under is tried, and anything unexpected degrades to
 * `undefined` rather than throwing. The caller keeps its text field, so a
 * runtime where this fails is inconvenient, never broken.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT importing `obsidian` (this plugin's file-scope split,
 * `src/obsidian-import-guard.test.ts`), which also keeps it unit-testable:
 * the Electron lookup goes through the injectable `loadElectron` parameter.
