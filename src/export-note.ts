/**
 * `obsidian`-free logic behind the two export commands (GitHub issue #28
 * slice 1): "Export Markii note as HTML" and "Export Markii note as PDF".
 * This module owns the command flow, the outcome shape, the failure
 * classification, and every user-facing string the two commands produce.
 * `main.ts` is wiring only: it finds the active note, reads its text and its
 * last-run values, hands this module a `NoteExportFs` backed by the vault
 * adapter, and shows the `Notice` this module worded.
 *
 * The rendering goes through `@markii/host`'s `buildNoteExport` (GitHub
 * issue #28, slice 2): a host that has React and a loaded pack registry in
 * front of it (`main.ts` wires this from the open preview, or loads one on
 * demand) renders the body itself, so an exported note's pack components
 * are the real components, not the static engine's unknown-component box.
 * A host with no packs loaded, or no renderer to hand over, falls back to
 * `@markii/html`'s static engine, the same document slice 1 produced. This
 * module decides nothing about WHICH engine ran; it only threads
 * `render`, `buildNoteExport`'s account of that choice, into the outcomes
 * this module already reports.
 *
 * THE PDF SEAM. Printing needs Electron, which exists only in a real
 * Obsidian desktop window and cannot be imported under Vitest. So the
 * command takes an `HtmlToPdf` function and knows nothing else about how a
 * PDF is produced (`./export/html-to-pdf.ts` is the one module that touches
 * Electron). Every failure of that function, from "this device has no
 * Electron surface at all" to "printing threw", degrades to writing the
 * HTML file instead — the user always ends up with an exported note.
