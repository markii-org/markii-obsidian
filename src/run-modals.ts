 * Imports `obsidian` — added deliberately to `src/obsidian-import-guard.test.ts`'s
 * allowlist alongside `main.ts`/`view.tsx`/`settings-tab.ts`. Kept in its
 * own file rather than folded into `view.tsx` (which is where these are
 * used) purely to keep that file from growing into the kind of
 * do-everything module `apps/vscode/src/preview-panel.ts` became; nothing
 * here is unit-testable anyway (it's modal UI wiring), so the split costs
 * nothing.
 *
 * Wording is NOT re-authored here: every message string comes straight
 * from `@markii/host`'s exported builders (`hostPromptMessage`,
 * `UNKNOWN_HOSTS_PROMPT_MESSAGE`, `manyHostsPromptMessage`) and its
 * `ALLOW_LABEL`/`DONT_ALLOW_LABEL` button labels — the same ones
 * `apps/vscode/src/preview-panel.ts`'s prompt adapters use, so the wording
 * lives in exactly one place regardless of host.
