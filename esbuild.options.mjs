/**
 * One published bundle, one build script:
 *
 *   `dist/main.js` — Obsidian expects a plugin's entry to be named exactly
 *   `main.js` sitting directly in its plugin folder alongside
 *   `manifest.json` and `styles.css` — but that plugin folder is the
 *   *installed* location inside a vault
 *   (`<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/markii/`), not this workspace directory
 *   itself. Building to `dist/` (rather than dropping `main.js` at the
 *   workspace root) keeps the generated bundle covered by the repo's
 *   existing `dist/` ignore/lint-exclusion patterns, the same way every
 *   other workspace's build output already is; the manual-install steps
 *   (see the task report) copy `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and every
 *   file under `dist/` into that plugin folder. Format `cjs` (Obsidian
 *   loads a plugin's `main.js` the same way VS Code loads an extension's
 *   `main`, via `require`), platform `browser` (the plugin runs inside
 *   Obsidian's renderer process, not a plain Node host), with `obsidian`
 *   and Electron/Node builtins marked external — Obsidian injects
 *   `obsidian` itself at runtime, and Electron's own built-ins (plus
 *   `node:worker_threads`, which `@markii/host`'s `spawnRun` uses
 *   directly — Obsidian desktop's renderer runs with Node integration,
 *   exactly like the other Node builtins this bundle already externalizes)
 *   are never something a plugin bundle should inline.
 *
 * `worker.browser.js` — the Web Worker entry for the Run path's
 * terminatable isolate (`@markii/host`'s `run/worker-entry-browser.ts` —
 * see AGENTS.md's `packages/markii-host` entry) — is no longer written to
 * `dist/` as its own file. It is built IN-PROCESS (`buildEmbeddedAssets`
 * below) and base64-embedded straight into `main.js`, along with wasmoon's
 * `glue.wasm`. That is a deliberate change from the old two-file-plus-wasm
 * layout: Obsidian's single-file install channels (BRAT today, the
 * community plugin catalogue later) fetch only `main.js`, `manifest.json`,
 * and `styles.css` — a Run path that depended on `worker.browser.js`/
 * `glue.wasm` being copied alongside those three would silently do nothing
 * for anyone who installed that way. Embedding the bytes makes a 3-file
 * install fully functional. See `createMainBuild`'s `embed-runtime-assets`
 * plugin and `src/run/embedded-assets.ts`/`src/run/browser-worker.ts` for
 * the decode-and-blob-URL half on the consuming side.
 *
 * There is no esbuild-wasm runtime in `dist/` at all: this plugin is
 * archive-only, with no pack compiler of its own (AGENTS.md's Host
 * positioning — VS Code is the authoring host and owns pack compilation
 * and packaging). A pack loads only in its prebuilt form
 * (`src/packs/pack-context.ts`); a folder with no prebuilt `webview.js` is
 * skipped, never compiled. So the full `dist/` a build produces is just
 * `main.js`.
 *
 * `@markii/*` resolves to each package's `src/`, exactly like
 * `scripts/workspace-aliases.config.ts` does for Vite/Vitest, and exactly
 * like `apps/vscode/esbuild.config.mjs` does for its own bundles: the
 * published `exports` maps point at `dist/`, which this repo's
 * `npm run build` (a `tsc --noEmit` typecheck per workspace) deliberately
 * does not produce. That map cannot be imported from here — it is
 * TypeScript and this file is plain ESM run by node — so the roots are
 * repeated below; keep this in sync with `scripts/workspace-aliases.config.ts`
 * if a package this plugin uses changes location.
